# SentiVerse

SentiVerse is a minimal template project for experimenting with sentiment analysis services. The repository serves as a starting point for building APIs or microservices that analyze text sentiment.

## Project Goals

* Provide a simple foundation to build sentiment analysis features.
* Demonstrate how to containerize a Python service using Docker.

## Getting Started

These instructions cover local development using Docker. Make sure Docker is installed on your machine.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://example.com/sentiverse.git
cd sentiverse

# Build the Docker image
docker build -t sentiverse .
```

## Environment Variables

The service expects a few environment variables when running the container:

* `PORT` - HTTP port the service should listen on (default `8000`).
* `OPENAI_API_KEY` - API key for a sentiment model provider.

Create a `.env` file or pass these variables directly to `docker run`.

## Running the Application

```bash
# Example using environment variables passed on the command line
docker run -p 8000:8000 \
  -e PORT=8000 \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here \
  sentiverse
```

The service will start on the specified port. Actual API endpoints depend on the code you build on top of this template.

## Basic Usage Example

```bash
# Suppose the app exposes an /analyze endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/analyze \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "I love open source"}'
```

The response would contain the computed sentiment.

## Contributing

This project is intentionally lightweight. Feel free to extend it with additional features such as model integrations, database storage, or a user interface.
